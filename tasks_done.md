# Tasks Completed

- **Fix `06_evaluate_alternative_models.ipynb`:** The notebook was failing due to a `FileNotFoundError` caused by hardcoded model filenames. The notebook has been updated to dynamically find the latest saved models for both logistic regression and random forest, ensuring it always uses the most recent versions.
